# GSR_Global
A Project that attempts to emulate real-world business enterprise software. Uses a MYSQL database to help manage orders, customers, and inventories for a business while offering the ability to filter data in a dynamic and meaningful way.

Project contains code that was used to psuedo-randomly generate data to populate the database (to avoid accidentally using real information)

Contains input validation using Regular Expressions throughout program. For ex, see src/main/java/view/orderdb/NewCustomerFrame.java line 67

To run the program, download GSR_Global-1.0.jar

The program was compiled with Oracle Open JDK v20.0.2
As such, you will need a JDK as up to date or more up to date than this version
